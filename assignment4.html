            In this project, I used the servos library along with a motion sensor. Because we haven't worked with 
            motion sensors in class yet (besides tilt switches) I did some googling to see how it worked. For this project assignment, when motion is detected, 
            the servos will turn 90 degrees and turn back to 0 when there is no motion. While using the motion sensor, there is a delay time in between motion and not motion as
            you can see in the gif, but it still does work as expected after a few tests. The input is the motion sensor and the output is the servos spinning.
            Pin 7 is used on the motion sensors as digital to detect high or low and Pin 9~ is used to customize how we want the servos to move in analog.
