            Below is the schematic, circuit and firmware! For this assignment I wanted to flip the logic and turn have the LED turn on when it's dark
            outside and when it gets bright, the LED will turn off. Kind of like automatic headlights or outdoor houselights! When building the circuit, I used
            a resistor of 220 ohms because it limits the current for both the blue and red LEDs to below 30mA. With the calculations anything over 160 Ohms should work fine 
            for LED. I used the same resistor value for the photoresistor. This time I learned how to post a snippet of the code which was very exciting. In the gif, it is 
            demonstrated what happens to the LED when a phone light shines on the photoresistor. If the value is below 30, the LED will shine.
